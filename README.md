This research work is to assign ranks to human facial emotions. 
Ranking of emotions is done at a scale of 3 levels. Namely, LOW, MEDIUM and HIGH.
Ranks are assigned with help of an algorithm named Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). This LRP is one of the best algorithm under eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI).
