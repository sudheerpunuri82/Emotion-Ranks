This research work is to assign ranks to human facial emotions. 
Ranking of emotions is done at a scale of 3 levels. Namely, LOW, MEDIUM and HIGH.
Ranks are assigned with help of an algorithm named Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). This LRP is one of the best algorithm under eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI).

Emotion_Ranks using CKPlus Dataset_with Relevance Scores Display.ipynb, has the complete code for displaying relevance scores & Calculating the emotion Ranks for CKPlus dataset and also rank calculation for an real-time image taken from AffectNet dataset, downloaded from Kaggle.
